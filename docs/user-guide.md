**Note:** The site has frequent backups and post versioning so if you muck up don't worry - message support and we can roll things back.

### Preparation

Prepare sponsor logo artwork as JPEG less than 2mb. Saving as JPEG quality 'high' 85% is usually good enough to get most logo artwork under 2mb.

You need to be logged in with the correct access rights to add sponsor - raise a [ticket](https://force11.org/submit-ticket/) on the site if you need support or message [#website](https://force11.slack.com/archives/C01LW0EK8S1) channel on Slack.

Note: **About the Gutenberg Editor** - The concept of the Wordpress Gutenberg editor is that content is broken down into **Blocks**. These blocks can be as small as a header, or paragraph. The idea being it makes content reusable and structured, and to offer feature rich editing - like complex tables, galleries, media embedding, etc. In the Gutenberg editor interface on the left you see the structure, center content, right settings.

   d. Image settings and resizing. When a Block is selected the right-hand pane has setting for the specific Block. The right-hand pane can also be set to display document other settings. Importantly for your logo upload you will want to edit: image size, Alt tag, and highlight field. Image size can also be done with drag-and-drop in the center pane.

   Note: Drag and drop image resize stays in aspect ratio, whereas numerical editing on the right does not.

#### Sponsor info upload

  1. Here well add sponsor to their respective sponsor list: gold, silver, etc. Using the inline editing well add an H3 header and a paragraph. You can look over existing content in the editor to see how things are done, or copy paste blocks.

  2. We'll start with adding a H3 header. First to add a new block you need to move your mouse under block above where you want to add your H3 header (new block). Look for the boxed + symbol.

  Then select Header from the blocks listed. Once inserted you you can set the header level - H1 to H6 - here we want H3.
