## Add sponsor to conference sponsors page

**Note:** The site has frequent backups and post versioning so if you muck up don't worry - message support and we can roll things back.

### Preparation

Prepare sponsor logo artwork as JPEG less than 2mb. Saving as JPEG quality 'high' 85% is usually good enough to get most logo artwork under 2mb.

You need to be logged in with the correct access rights to add sponsor - raise a [ticket](https://force11.org/submit-ticket/) on the site if you need support or message [#website](https://force11.slack.com/archives/C01LW0EK8S1) channel on Slack.

  1. Navigate to the 'Sponsors' page in the secondary menu of the Conference top level menu item.

Note: **About the Gutenberg Editor** - The concept of the Wordpress Gutenberg editor is that content is broken down into Block. These blocks can be as small as a header, or paragraph, the idea being it makes content reusable and structured. On the left you see the structure, center content, right settings.
